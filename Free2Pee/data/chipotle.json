I went in the store at 6:17pm, checked the shelves, there was nothing and sat down to patiently wait. After a while, I asked the staff what is the status of the order and before I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted with “did you check the shelves” and the lady turned around and walked away.\n\nI waited longer and around 6:50pm I decided to ask again. The lady dismissively said “it’s literally being prepared now” — 30 minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready. Another customer asked for her take out and the lady ignored her and walked away, to which the customer responded “or you can ignore me and be rude”. When my order was ready, the lady threw the bag at me. I took it and left.\n\nTo my disappointment, the bowls were half-filled, many ingredients were missing.\n\nI understand staff are being overworked, but that does not change the fact that this lady’s attitude is horrible, wait times are long, and you might not get what you ordered.",

She ignored the mute customer who tried to show her a message he wrote by putting it in front of her face, even after learning he was mute. Clearly whatever was on her phone was much more important. They refused in person orders; made it seem like a temporary thing but I’ve seen reviews from a year ago saying the same thing. Refused to finish order on time saying there are “20 other orders ahead.” Also chose not to communicate that the order could not be done on time even when previously told customer is in a rush to catch a bus. Instead chose to remain silent and make the customer wait for 15 minutes only to leave without receiving the food. My sincere condolences to whichever unfortunate souls that step foot in this sorry excuse for a chipotle. Almost every other genuine comment here has detailed a similar experience with low rating. They seemed to have somehow rigged the algorithm to keep the overall score at 3.3, because there is no way that accurately reflects peoples’ experiences here.",
